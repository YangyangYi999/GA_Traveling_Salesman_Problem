Language: JAVA

Project contains 2 packages. 

The first package is com.me.GA, it contains 7 classes related to genetic algorithm. 

The second package is com.me.test, this package contains all the unit test of this program.

Run project without graph : TSP.java
Run project with grap:TSP_Graph.java  Shows the best route graph
